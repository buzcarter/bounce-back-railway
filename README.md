# Bounce Back Railway

A JavaScript visual prototype implementation for a mini-train microcontroller that auto-reverses at the ends of a straight track, with any number of intermediate stops. Perfect for model railroaders looking for a simple and fun automation solution.

This simplified prototype railway is for debugging logic before completeing the micro-conroller (C++) coding and circuit schematics.
